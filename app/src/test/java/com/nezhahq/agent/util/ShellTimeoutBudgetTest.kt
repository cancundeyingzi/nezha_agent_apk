/**
 * Pins the timing relationship that keeps a slow privileged command from killing the connection.
 *
 * The metrics loop reads `/proc` through the shared shell every
 * [DashboardSessionWatchdog.STATE_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS], so a command holding that shell delays the
 * next state report by however long it runs. Once the gap between receipts reaches
 * [DashboardSessionWatchdog.STATE_RECEIPT_TIMEOUT_MS] the agent tears the session down — including
 * any file transfer or terminal in flight. A 120-second upload copy on the shared shell made that
 * a certainty, which is what `RootShell.executeIsolated` now exists to prevent.
 *
 * These two constants live in modules that cannot see each other, so nothing but this test stops
 * one from drifting past the other.
